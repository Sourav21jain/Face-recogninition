# Face-recogninition
Hi, In this project you need to install few things before starting with it

Things i have done 
1) I have run the code on linux operation system which is rhel8 
2) You have to setup jupyter-notebook you can go with pip or anaconda 
3) I have used the virtual machine so make sure your webcam is connected 
4) Import the opencv-python to run the code 


In this project the face is captured and its model is trained to the code and then using cv it is scanning the files and the face parally and checking does face matches if yes then it will unlock the system.
